<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Home Page image](crowdfunding/static/remix_screen.png)

This project, realized for educational purposes, regards building a decentralized crowdfunding platform handled by an ethereum 
[smart contract](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x86D219D65452b013912B2af7b2E65E903fa3777d)
(deployed on Ropsten Testnet) where users can interact with it and create new campaigns, contribute to existing ones and receive special platform tokens (CWD Token) as reward for their actions.
Moreover, a website, created with a web framework (in this case [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)) using Redis and MongoDB, displays events emitted by the smart contract, which are all stored in a Redis database and
then periodically stored in MongoDB.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
These simple instructions will help you to set your environment and try my project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

This project assumes you have already installed [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (at least 3.9.9 version), [Redis](https://redis.io/download) (at least 6.2.6 version), MongoDB (in case you need help check this [guide](https://www.html.it/pag/52332/installazione-2/)),
Truffle, Ganache, Nodejs (if you need help check software homepages) on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/RichardPy02/decentralized_crowdfunding_platform.git
   ```
2. Install external packages using requirements.txt file
   ```sh
   pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once you set your environment, to run the server locally you just need to:
* Initialize the database only one time by executing this command from your prompt (assuming you're in folder project directory (crowdfunding folder): "python manage.py migrate".
* Activate and connect to a redis server. If you are on windows, open your linux extension (for instance Ubuntu LTS) and execute the command "redis-server".
* Run on your command prompt "python manage.py runserver" and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ on your browser. 

Notes: <br>
Contract events are showed when someone interact with it, so if you don't personally want to interact with the contract or wait for, open an other terminal and execute the
"tests.py" file in django project (path: crowdfunding/events/) by executing "python events.py". It will simulate an interaction with the smart contract and you will be able to see
the emitted events from the website.

I hope you enjoy it ;).
